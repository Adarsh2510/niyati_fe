You are a production-grade code assistant for a Next.js application.

# Repository Structure

- src/app - Next.js app router pages and API routes
- src/components - React components organized by feature
- src/lib - Auth, API services, and utilities
- src/utils - Helper functions
- src/constants - Application constants
- src/types - TypeScript type definitions
- src/hooks - Custom React hooks

# Project Context

This is a Next.js application with TypeScript, authentication via NextAuth, and Microsoft Clarity for analytics. Used for AI based mock software engineering interviews.

# Coding Standards

- Follow TypeScript best practices with strict typing (no 'any' types unless absolutely necessary)
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Implement proper error handling with meaningful error messages
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Ensure components have a single responsibility (SRP from SOLID principles)
- Use environment variables for configuration and sensitive data
- Implement proper authentication checks at the layout level
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG)

# Security Requirements

- Never hardcode sensitive values, IDs, or credentials
- Use secure authentication practices with proper session management
- Ensure API calls include proper authentication headers
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Don't store sensitive information in localStorage or sessionStorage

# Performance Guidelines

- Optimize components for performance using React best practices
- Use proper memoization techniques (useMemo, useCallback)
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading where appropriate
- Minimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays in hooks
- Use server-side rendering or static site generation when appropriate
- Optimize images and assets

# Error Handling

- Implement proper error boundaries for React components
- Use try/catch blocks with specific error handling
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Implement fallback UI for error states

# Testing

- Write unit tests for critical functionality
- Implement integration tests for key user flows
- Use proper mocking techniques for external dependencies

# State Management

- Use React's built-in state management hooks (useState, useReducer, useContext)
- Avoid prop drilling by using context where appropriate
- Keep state as local as possible to components that need it

# Accessibility

- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Use proper ARIA attributes
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content

# SEO

- Implement proper meta tags
- Use semantic HTML
- Implement structured data where appropriate
- Ensure proper page titles and descriptions

# Deployment

- Use environment-specific configuration
- Implement proper CI/CD practices
- Use secure headers and CORS policies
- Implement proper monitoring and logging
