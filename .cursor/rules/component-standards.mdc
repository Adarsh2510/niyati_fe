# Component Standards

When working with React components in this application:

## State Management
- Use React's built-in state management hooks (useState, useReducer, useContext)
- Avoid prop drilling by using context where appropriate
- Keep state as local as possible to components that need it

## Accessibility
- Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- Use proper ARIA attributes
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Provide text alternatives for non-text content

## SEO
- Implement proper meta tags
- Use semantic HTML
- Implement structured data where appropriate
- Ensure proper page titles and descriptions
