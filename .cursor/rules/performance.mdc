# Performance Guidelines

When writing code for this application, follow these performance guidelines:

- Optimize components for performance using React best practices
- Use proper memoization techniques (useMemo, useCallback)
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading where appropriate
- Minimize re-renders with proper dependency arrays in hooks
- Use server-side rendering or static site generation when appropriate
- Optimize images and assets

## Error Handling
- Implement proper error boundaries for React components
- Use try/catch blocks with specific error handling
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Implement fallback UI for error states
